# DES Encryption algorithm
## Description:
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm. DES is a symmetric-key block cipher that encrypts data in blocks of 64 bits using a 56-bit key. The implementation follows the standard DES encryption process, including initial permutation, expansion, substitution using S-boxes, permutation, XOR with round keys, and final permutation.


## Features:

### DES Encryption: Implements the DES encryption algorithm to encrypt a 64-bit plaintext message with a set of 16 round keys.
### Modular Design: Encapsulates each step of the DES algorithm in separate functions for readability and maintainability.
### Tested with Example: Includes a test case with a sample plaintext message and round keys to verify the correctness of the implementation.
### Comments and Documentation: Provides comments throughout the code for better understanding and documentation of each function.


## Files:

 main.py: Contains the Python implementation of the DES encryption algorithm.
 README.md: Provides an overview of the repository, including usage instructions and a description of the DES algorithm.


## Usage:

 Clone the repository to your local machine.
 Run main.py and provide the plaintext message and round keys as input to encrypt your message.
 Optionally, review the code comments in main.py for a detailed explanation of each step.
